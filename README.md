# Electric-Vehicle-Sales-by-State-in-India

Hello, GitHub community, I am excited to share my Third Project as a Data Analyst Intern at Unified Mentor Private Limited. This project involved Electric Vehicle Sales by State in India, Data obtained from Unified Mentor Private Limited itself.

Market segmentation becomes a crucial tool for evolving transportation technology such as electric vehicles (EVs) in emerging markets to explore and implement for extensive adoption. EV adoption is expected to grow phenomenally shortly as low-emission and low-operating-cost cars, and thus, it drives a considerable amount of forthcoming academic research curiosity. The main aim of this study is to explore and identify distinct sets of potential buyer segments for EVs based on psychographic, behavioral, and socio-economic characterization by employing an integrated research framework of ‘perceived benefits-attitude-intention’.

**Steps Involved:**

**Data Collection:** Load and inspect the dataset.

**Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, convert date formats, and perform feature engineering.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize trends and relationships between variables.

**Feature Engineering:** Create new features from the date column and encode categorical variables.

**Modeling:** Build a regression model to predict EV sales.

**Evaluation:** Evaluate the model performance and interpret the results.

**Visualization:** Visualize the results and trends using graphs and charts.



**Technologies Used:**
Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
